# Clustering and Cloud Computing Project
## Cloud-based Sentiment Analysis with Social Media Data (Twitter Data)

The focus of this project is to harvest tweets from across the cities of Australia on the NeCTAR Research Cloud and undertake a variety of social media data analytics scenarios that tell interesting stories of life in Australian cities, especially for those tweeters who travel inter-cities frequently. Alongside with data from AURIN platform, we also analyze the relationship between residents demographic background against the pattern how they tweet.

This project provides a Cloud-based solution that exploits a multitude of virtual machines(VMs) across the NeCTAR Research Cloud for harvesting tweets through the Twitter APIs. Our solution includes 5 major components, for each, the code can be found in the corresponding folders under the folder 'code'.
